            <div class="content">
                <p>Sudoku is a puzzle game you play on a peice of paper divided
                    into a 9x9 square, which is then divided into 9 3x3 sections.
                     You must make the numbers 1-9 fit in each row, column, and 
                     square without repeating.</p>
                <h4>Origin</h4>
                <p>The first modern game of Sudoku appeared in Japan in 1984. Sudoku 
                    puzzles gained popularity for their ease of understanding, ease
                     of use when communiting, and because number puzzles work better
                     in the Japanese language then words do. Sudoku was introduced to
                     the Western world in March of 1997.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Crossword Puzzles are word games, usually in a square shaped grid
                        full of black and white squares. You are given hints for down and 
                        across words. The answers are written down in the white spaces on the 
                        grid. </p>
                    <h4>Origin</h4>
                    <p>Crossword puzzles were first invented by British journalist 
                        Authur Wynne. They picked up popularity after being published 
                        in the New York Times during the early 1920s. From that point, 
                        crosswords evolved into other letter based games, such as the 
                        board game Scrabble and the online game "Words with Friends".</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Coded Quotes are like ciphers. You are given a phrase in a scrambled
                        letter format, and you need to assign the correct letters to break
                        the code. So, the word "the" may be spelt "abc", which means t=a, 
                        h=b, and e=c.</p>
                    <h4>Origins</h4>
                    <p>Ciphers have been around for thousands of years, with the first 
                        documented one was created by the Greeks in 400 BCE, and were 
                        used to pass secret messages between military units and commanders.</p>

                        operators.</p>
                    <h4>Origins</h4>
                    <p>The game means "More or Less" in Japanese, and was developed by Tamaki 
                        Seto in 2001. Futoshiki is popular in the UK, and is published in many

                    <p>There are 2 different rumored origins to the puzzle. One is Tohu wa Vohu
                        (Tic Tac Logic), created by Adolfo Zanellati. The second rumored origin is 
                        for Binario as described above, which was created by Peter De Schepper and
